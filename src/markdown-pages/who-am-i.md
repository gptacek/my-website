Hello! I'm a third year student at Vassar College majoring in Computer Science and Chinese. I'm from San Francisco and identify as Taiwanese American and biracial. 

I hope to learn more about software engineering and eventually join a company that reflects my beliefs in equality, social justice, and making the world a better place.

Outside of the classroom, I've been actively involved with lots of different orgs. My second year I was the president of the Asian Students' Alliance, I've edited for Vassar's Asian students magazine: [Portrait](https://issuu.com/vcportrait) for the past 3 issues and written in the last one (link coming soon), and I'm a member of Vassar's Asian American Studies Working Group, which seeks to bring a more robust Asian American Studies program to Vassar.

In the past, I've had the opportunity to intern at two different labs at UCSF, the first one in high school was the [Ashrafi lab](https://ashrafilab.ucsf.edu/) and the second was after my first year of college, where I helped members of the [Kato lab](http://saulkato.com/focolab/index.htm) with their computational neurology projects both from the Computer Science and Biological perspectives.

Back in high school, I was the co-president of the Asian / Asian Pacific Islander club my senior year and founded the multiracial club with three other classmates. I was also the lead volunteer for [Project Cicero](https://projectcicero.org/) in San Francisco, a book drive for teachers around the Bay Area. I was also a National Merit Scholarship Finalist.
